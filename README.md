# User bulk change role #

This plugin assigns or unassign roles to all selected users, within a selected context. It does not (at least for the moment) enrol/unenrole users to courses.

Caution advised, specially in production environments, since bulk role changes may not be easily undone and may produce a lot of capabilities' problems.
